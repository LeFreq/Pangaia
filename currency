The World Game creates a new currency that is deliberatly separate from the existing physical currency system.  Eventually, a cryptocurrency would be ideal for a software implementation (perhaps utilizing "smart" phones).

Some basic rules-of-thumb:
* a single vote up (or down possibly) -- 1 unit or World Coin
* A single seed bomb (composed of seeds to transform rotted or empty landscapes) -- 5 units
* A safe BASE jump and photo/a sleepable couch -- 50 units (unsafe BASE jump (or couch):  10 units)
* A working app that does something non-trivial (regardless of licensing) -- 500 units (a GPL app: maybe 5000 units)
* A new engine that is twice as efficient as on the market -- 5000 units.

Pangaia points can be converted into a "note" to make for easier handling.  There are three denominations of currency:

* The "yes" coin -- the smallest unit of +value -- the basic vote in the World Game
* The "wow" note -- 10x the smallest unit
* The "woah!" note -- at 100x unit.
* The "*mindblown*" note -- at 1000x the unit.

Units stay in the system until they are transferred out by:
# giving to the governance nodes
# losing them:  talk to the GM, it may be possible to retrieve
#

Conversion to and from physical currency should never occur, except through a layer of indirection, to stay separate from the tax collection system.  For example, you might get the World Game to get a couch for the space using World Coin, only to sell it in real space later for the legal tender.
