Welcome to the World Game, scaling the hackerspaces and making a creative economy.  Pangaia comes from Buckminster Fuller's idea of a Game society plays to mend the world and James Lovelock's theory of Earth as a self-organizing system (Gaia Hypothesis).  It will create something akin to Minsky's Society of Mind.

We're here quietly developing the world's next great economic and information revolution...

* Utilizing the power and wisdom of *the crowd* (given the right tools and incentives), we are
* creating a distributed *peer-to-peer* platform for trading creative value (a new economic system),
* while allocating decision-making authority fairly and efficiently (a new form of *self-organizing governance*)
* using a stellar theoretical *3d model* for organizing people and projects (which we claim is provably optimal)
* in a way that inspires even *greater* participation (a la Reed's Law).

...ultimately to create a beautiful world.  If you're looking to start now, start with the working paper version (here or wiki.hackerspaces.org/PangaiaWorldGame) and implement the BusinessPlan.  The paper version is fully FUNctional and will demonstraate the principles of "self-organization".  It is a LARP (a live-action role-playing game) that creates it`s own currency as you go, rewarding you for generating community value.  The Business Plan is to give you ideas on how to start organizing and filling whatever space you have.

Check the wiki for more.  Remember:  it only takes an empty space and a corkboard to make things HAPPEN!  If you're looking for the platform for creating an application developer and data lover's nirvana, check out the PositionOS project under this user.  This project is now strictly limited to hackerspaces and decentralized project management.
