The World Game creates a new currency that is deliberatly separate from the existing physical currency system.  Eventually, a cryptocurrency would be ideal for a software implementation (perhaps utilizing "smart" phones).

There are three denominations of currency:

* The "yes" coin -- the smallest unit of value
* The "wow" unit -- a 10x the smallest unit
* The "woah!" unit -- a 100x unit.

Units stay in the system until they are transferred out by
# giving to the governance nodes
# 

Conversion to and from physical currency should never occur except through a layer of indirection, to stay separate from the tax collection system.
